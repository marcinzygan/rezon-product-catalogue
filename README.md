# Commercial Next.js App: Online Product Catalogue for Rezon.eu

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @marcinzygan

I've been asked to prepare an online catalogue for my current employer, Rezon.eu. The idea is to showcase about 200 products, including title, image, description, price, and technology used. This project uses Redux for state management. The data for this project was taken from an Excel file and parsed to JSON. In the future, this project will be integrated with another application (PC Business) to update storage levels and manage orders.
